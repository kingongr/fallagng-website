- **Size**: 1920x1080px or larger
- **Format**: JPG or WebP
- **Purpose**: Landing page hero background

## Adding New Images

1. Add your image files to the appropriate directory
2. Update the corresponding JSON file (`content/members.json`, `content/videos.json`) with the correct file paths
3. Ensure file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

## Placeholder Images

If an image is missing, the website will gracefully fallback to gradient backgrounds. However, it's recommended to add all images for the best user experience.
